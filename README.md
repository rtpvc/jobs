## What we are building
At RTP, we create the Venture Capital Operating System, starting with our own Data Intelligence Platform that helps us find and track the best founders and startups as early as possible. We believe venture capital is changing, and digital is driving a big part of this change. By combining the wealth of (open source) data available online with a strong and knowledgeable deal team, we can invest in the next generation of founders earlier and with more conviction than our competitors.

## Remote & freelance OK
This means that you don't have to show up in an RTP office (but you can if you like). You work from your own location but are in a timezone with enough overlap with the rest of the team (Roughly: EMEA, between New York and Moscow, GMT-4 to GMT+3). We can hire you on our payroll but prefer to work together in the first months on a freelance basis. This should be OK for you and something you've done before. How we interact is mostly a-sync: written specs (we use Linear for issue tracking and project management), simple communication (text-based via Slack), and video calls when needed (Zoom).
